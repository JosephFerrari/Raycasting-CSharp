# Raycasting-CSharp

This is a raycasting game engine based on Wolfenstein 3D I made as a project for my Computer Science A-Level in 2019.

The game uses a maze generating algorithm to arrange pre-designed rooms for a randomised experience each time through.
The world is rendered using simple textured raycasting that allows for horizontal and vertical scaling and transparency.
The player will traverse through the dungeon opening secret panels on the walls, collecting ammunition, health and keys to progress through locked gates.
The map is littered with monsters for the player to fight off with their fists and a variety of guns with different firing rates and damage.
Despite only supporting horizontal turning of the camera, an on-screen crosshair allows the player to aim vertically and hit higher damage for landing headshots.
The game assigns points for fighting and applies a multiplier for combos if you can land lots of hits in a short amount of time.
